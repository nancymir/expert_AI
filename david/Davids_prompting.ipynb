    "# Thought process\n",
    "Nancy and I were tasked with making slides for each other and were not able to see what the other had put down so it was up to the prompting to make the slides sound as normal and as personable as possible. One issue that made the presentations sound more like a human expert was when the presenters would show more emotion or speak about things that weren't on the slides. I think if both read exactly what was on the slides it would make it more difficult to differentiate which was made by a human and which was made by an AI. For my prompting I used Chat GPT 3.5 and these were the promptings I used and the results. "
