Prompting LLMs to act as experts in a field. How do they compare to the human expert?

Nancy and I were tasked with making slides for each other and were not able to see what the other had put down so it was up to the prompting to make the slides sound as normal and as personable as possible. One issue that made the presentations sound more like a human expert was when the presenters would show more emotion or speak about things that weren't on the slides. It made people question the validity of the other presentation because it showed the person knew more than just what was put on the presentations. If both people read exactly what was on the slides, it would make it more difficult to differentiate which was made by a human and which was made by an AI. For my prompting David used Chat GPT 3.5, while Nancy used Chat GPT 3.5 turbo. It would be interesting if the other models would give more up to date information or new updates. These were the promptings we used and the results.
